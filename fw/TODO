TODO:
- verify PWM functionality with probe
- why doesn't PWM work in simavr?
- Add encoder support to sim

- Switch to round-robin, interrupt-driven ADC reading into a uint16_t[8] of "latest readings".  An tick() would disable and re-enable this interrupt so it can happen "in between" ticks.
- Consider dynamically changing ADC "resolution" to something faster for voltage and function select.
