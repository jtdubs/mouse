ADC:
- Switch to round-robin, interrupt-driven ADC reading into a uint16_t[8] of "latest readings".  An tick() would disable and re-enable this interrupt so it can happen "in between" ticks.
- Consider dynamically changing ADC "resolution" to something faster for voltage and function select.

Encoders:
- Need support in the simulator, ideally based on the PWM value.
- So, basically model a "motor" that takes the PWM and Dir inputs, and produces the encoder outputs.

UI:
- Fold "USB" directly into "mouse" and "UI".

General:
- Review level of documentation.
