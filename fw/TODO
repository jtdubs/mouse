Firmware:
- Pull out lots of constants into some sort header file or something i dunno
- Motion planning for linear motion with accel / coast / decel phases?

plans:
- linear motion: move to position with risidual speed, completes once position is reached
- rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached

sim:
- the current_plan.state field is a super cool idea for a breakpoint.........!
