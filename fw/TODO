Firmware:
- Helper function to put platform into known quiet state and turn off control signals
- Main loop should only indirectly affect "control" by poking setpoints?
- Motion planning for linear motion with accel / coast / decel phases?
- On tick, update approximate x,y,theta based on encoder deltas
- Add x,y,theta to the report


plans:
- move to position with risidual speed, completes once position is reached
- turn to angle, completes once angle is reached
