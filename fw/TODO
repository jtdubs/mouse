TODO:
- Move digital logic probes to unused sensor ports (3,4,5).
- Only init ADC functionality on the ADCs we use (0, 1, 2, 6, 7).
- Sanity check probe timings.
- Add MCU_VCD_PORT_PIN statements for other interesting pins.
- Confirm VCD files still look sane.
- Decode battery voltage and store in report as a uint16_t in millivolts.
- Switch to round-robin, interrupt-driven ADC reading into a uint16_t[8] of "latest readings".  An tick() would disable and re-enable this interrupt so it can happen "in between" ticks.
- Consider dynamically changing ADC "resolution" to something faster for voltage and function select.
- Read specs for motor driver 
- Read specs for encoder (why is there a encoder pulse doubler??)
- Build encoders, motors, and mount to board.
