Firmware:
- FIX: Linear motion planning, if it finishes braking to 0 early, is stuck "running" forever.
  - Should the braking be adaptive?  Add a backup "crawl" mode to close the gap?
- Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached.
- Pull out lots of constants into some sort header file or something i dunno.
- Once all the math is more generic (using contants), consider tightening up the tick to run every 1ms?

Sim:
- Use avr_cmd_register to register a breakpoint command, which we can call on plan state change.
