TODO:
- Read specs for encoder (why is there a encoder pulse doubler??)
- Test the encoder

- Add a pwm library
- Switch to round-robin, interrupt-driven ADC reading into a uint16_t[8] of "latest readings".  An tick() would disable and re-enable this interrupt so it can happen "in between" ticks.
- Consider dynamically changing ADC "resolution" to something faster for voltage and function select.

#define system for modules to declare ownership of pins and to error if they overlap...
this could also be a bitmask and be handled with asserts..
