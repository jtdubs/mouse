Motors:
- Encoder reversing isn't working (it still counts up)

ADC:
- Switch to round-robin, interrupt-driven ADC reading into a uint16_t[8] of "latest readings".
- An tick() would disable and re-enable this interrupt so it can happen "in between" ticks.
- Consider dynamically changing ADC "resolution" to something faster for voltage and function select.

Hardware:
- Solder up second motor w/ encoder
- Solder up a sensor board
