Firmware:
- FIX: Linear motion planning, if it finishes braking to 0 early, is stuck "running" forever.
- Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached.
- Pull out lots of constants into some sort header file or something i dunno.

UI:
- Allow building and transmitting of a multi-step plan to the firmware for execution.

Sim:
- Use avr_cmd_register to register a breakpoint command, which we can call on plan state change.
