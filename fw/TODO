Fw:
- Switch to round-robin, interrupt-driven ADC reading into a uint16_t[8] of "latest readings".
- An tick() would disable and re-enable this interrupt so it can happen "in between" ticks.
- Consider dynamically changing ADC "resolution" to something faster for voltage and function select.

UI:
- Fold "USB" directly into "mouse" and "UI".
