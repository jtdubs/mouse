Modes:
- Calibration mode:
  - Place mouse in center of box facing wall, let sensor calibrate against the "wall is present" values
  - Just accumulate 256 8-bit samples in a 16-bit counter, and keep the top byte
  - Consider only taking a sample every 10-20ms so it is averaged over a longer period of time (1-2s)
  - LED signal when done, or if failed
- Self-check mode:
  - Place mouse in center of box facing wall, with wheels off the ground
  - Turn on LEDs and confirm all sensors have a reading
  - Turn each wheel forward then backward a few revolutions to ensure encoders are working.
  - Confirm battery voltage in range
  - Have LED blink codes for error conditions
- Remote-control mode:
  - As-implemented
  - Eventually a "turn x degrees" and "move y mm" commands
  - Include wall-detection logic here and get rid of wall mode.

Sim:
- Track mouse absolute position via integral of motor speeds over time
- Add a "maze" that shows up in the UI
- Allow drag and drop of mouse within maze to update absolute position
- Allow reset of firmware for long-run tests
- Allow disabling VCD output
- Simulate IR readings based on wall distance in simulation

Fw:
- Better documentation of modules, how they work and what they do.

Motors:
- Encoder count is 240 per wheel revolution, so ~0.4mm
