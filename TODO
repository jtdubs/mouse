Platform:
- Nano every implementation

Sim and Remote:
- Both probably need a re-write.

Bazel:
- Auto-build cross-compile toolchain.

Exploration mode:
- There are definitely opportunities to speed up "unwinding" when a shortcut presents itself.
- Can also skip visiting cells if we've learned about all it's walls from other vantage points.

Hardware:
- Consider smaller wheels for more control at the expense of speed?
- How hard are we driving the motors currently?

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.
