Next steps:
- Add higher level primitives for moving by multiples of grid cells, and turning by multiples of 90 degrees.
  - UI can get basic arrow buttons for moving forward and turning left/right.
- Add a basic "maze" representation as a 2D array of wall types (4 bits per cell holding which sides have walls).
  - Update the sim to somehow render the robot's internal maze representation, ideally overlaid on the true maze.
    - We may not need this if we get the remote rendering the maze via the report...
  - Update the reports to include changes to the maze representation.
    - The reports probably need to be tightened up.  Maybe we need a way to only trasmit changes...
    - Or rotate through various reports at different frequences.
  - Update the UI to progressively render the maze based on the updates from the reports.
- Figure out at what point within a cell we can detect the presence/absence of walls from the next cell
  - "Advancing" a cell should move to this point, determine the wall status, then continue to the center of the cell.

Timer:
- Main timer interrupt should probably be ISR_NONBLOCK.
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?

Reports:
- Alternate between module-specific report (platform, control, maze)

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.

High-level phases of development:
[x] Learn to operate the hardware.
[x] Learn to drive specific distances / turn specific angles.
[x] Learn not to hit walls.
[ ] Learn to map out a maze.
[ ] Learn to drive the solution to a maze.
