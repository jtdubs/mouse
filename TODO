Firmware:
- Pull out the "platform" code into a nano BSP, and add one for the nano every.
- Probably switch to a better build system (cmake???)
- Add a speed ramp for rotation?

Sim and Remote:
- Both probably need a re-write.
- Remote as webapp using web serial??
- TBH, C might be easier if I can directly use structs from the mouse header files.

Timer:
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?

Exploration mode:
- There are definitely opportunities to speed up "unwinding" when a shortcut presents itself.
- Can also skip visiting cells if we've learned about all it's walls from other vantage points.

Hardware:
- Consider smaller wheels for more control at the expense of speed?
- How hard are we driving the motors currently?

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.
