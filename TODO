Firmware:
1. Test linear motion w/ actual robot
  a. Issue: Stopped early once, not enough power to "crawl" to target distance (29.5 vs 30?)
  b. Issue: Motors are not symmetric, one is stronger than the other, may need either fudge factors or a "steering correction"?
2. Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached
3. Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
4. Anti-crash failsafe of asserting sensor readings are below some sane threshold?
5. More assert to catch motors being set to "bad" values.

Remote:
1. Include plan in remote's VCD log somehow
2. Add a "pause" button that stops processing serial messages
3. Add a "reset" button that re-opens the serial port (which reset the robot)

PCB Improvements:
- Prevent BT board from interfering with normal USB serial comms
- Ideally the signal path is software selectable
