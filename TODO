Firmware:
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?
- Anti-crash failsafe of asserting sensor readings are below some sane threshold?
- Start using sensor readings for self-centering within hallways
