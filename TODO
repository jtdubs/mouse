Firmware:
1. Test linear motion w/ actual robot
  a. Issue: Stopped early once, not enough power to "crawl" to target distance (29.5 vs 30?)
  b. Issue: Motors are not symmetric, one is stronger than the other, may need either fudge factors or a "steering correction"?
2. Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached
3. Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?
  - Maybe we just want to try re-tuning the PID and then adding a small hand-tuned steering bias?
4. Anti-crash failsafe of asserting sensor readings are below some sane threshold?
5. More assert to catch motors being set to "bad" values.

Remote:
1. Include plan in remote's VCD log somehow
2. Add a "pause" button that stops processing serial messages
