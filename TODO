Firmware:
- Once all the math is more generic (using contants), consider tightening up the tick to run every 1ms?
- FIX: Linear motion planning, if it finishes braking to 0 early, is stuck "running" forever.
  - Should the braking be adaptive?  Add a backup "crawl" mode to close the gap?
- Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached.

Firmware:
- Include plan in report
- Increase baud rate??

Monitor:
- Show the current plan
