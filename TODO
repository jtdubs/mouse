Firmware:
1. Include plan in report
2. Test linear motion w/ actual robot
3. Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached
4. Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
5. Anti-crash failsafe of asserting sensor readings are below some sane threshold?
6. More assert to catch motors being set to "bad" values.

Remote:
1. Parse and show the current plan

PCB Improvements:
- Prevent BT board from interfering with normal USB serial comms
- Ideally the signal path is software selectable
