Solve mode:
- Pull out the {orientation, offset, stopped} into a struct, and then all the explore functions (face, advance, etc.) can be re-used by explore and solve...
- Just walks the distance gradient calculated by exploration mode and stops in the center.

Exploration mode:
- There are definitely opportunities to speed up "unwinding" when a shortcut presents itself.
- Can also skip visiting cells if we've learned about all it's walls from other vantage points.

Timer:
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?

Sim and Remote:
- Both probably need a re-write.
- TBH, C might be easier if I can directly use structs from the mouse header files.

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.

High-level phases of development:
[x] Learn to operate the hardware.
[x] Learn to drive specific distances / turn specific angles.
[x] Learn not to hit walls.
[x] Learn to map out a maze.
[ ] Learn to drive the solution to a maze.
