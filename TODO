Platform:
- Nano every implementation

Remote:
- Port to C++ as well

Maze:
- Smaller to represent as 256-bit bitmasks for each wall & visited status.

Bazel:
- Auto-build cross-compile toolchain.
- Vendor all dependencies.

Exploration mode:
- There are definitely opportunities to speed up "unwinding" when a shortcut presents itself.
- Can skip visiting cells if we've learned about all it's walls from other vantage points.

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.
