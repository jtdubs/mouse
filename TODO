Firmware:
- Linear motion seems to have a problem:
  - It ends the decel ramp at min motor speed, but we never get there because true speed lags the setpoint, and then we zero the motors and "slide" to a stop, counting about 16 ticks per motor after we set the speed to zero.
- Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?
- Anti-crash failsafe of asserting sensor readings are below some sane threshold?
- More assert to catch motors being set to "bad" values.

Remote:
- Include plan in remote's VCD log somehow
- Add a "pause" button that stops processing serial messages
