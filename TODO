Firmware:
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?
- Tick during linear plan takes 614us, anything I can do to optimize this down?
- Anti-crash failsafe of asserting sensor readings are below some sane threshold?

Remote:
- Include plan in remote's VCD log somehow
- Add a "pause" button that stops processing serial messages
- Add a "reest" button that resets the board, probably by triggering the watchdog??

Sim:
- Remove the "Adding IRQ" print statements

Environment:
- Not using built version of avrdude, try it then uninstall the package.
