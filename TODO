Firmware:
- Rotational motion: turn to angle, completes once angle is reached.  Would never want risidual rotational velocity.
- Test stuff w/ the actual robot... but like where though?
- Once all the math is more generic (using contants), consider tightening up the tick to run every 1ms?

Firmware:
- Include plan in report

Monitor:
- Show the current plan
