Exploration:
- Each visited cell gets min(neighbors) + 1.
- Also keep a queue of "visitable" squares that starts as [(0, 1)] and is updated as we visit cells w/ open walls.
- New loops becomes:
  - Choose a visitable cell.
  - Plan a route to it by walking the distance field by-directionally from current + visitable until they meet.
  - Drive the route.

Tuning:
- Corridor centering seems wobbily, set up a corridor and re-tune that motion.

Timer:
- Main timer interrupt should probably be ISR_NONBLOCK.
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.

High-level phases of development:
[x] Learn to operate the hardware.
[x] Learn to drive specific distances / turn specific angles.
[x] Learn not to hit walls.
[ ] Learn to map out a maze.
[ ] Learn to drive the solution to a maze.
