Bugs:
- Cell distance calculations are not working (probably not respecting walls + orientation correctly).
- Wall following works terribly immediately after a rotation.  No idea why.  Maybe sensor calculations in the sim are angle dependent?

Required troubleshooting features:
- Add some parse-out of the plan directly in the simulator so we aren't waiting for bluetooth messages.
- Update the "step forward" feature to step from plan start to plan start, skipping scheduled & implemented.

Exploration:
- Keep a queue of "visitable" squares that starts as [(0, 1)] and is updated as we visit cells w/ open walls.
- New loops becomes:
  - Choose a visitable cell.
  - Plan a route to it by walking the distance field bi-directionally from current + visitable until they meet.
  - Drive the route.

Timer:
- Main timer interrupt should probably be ISR_NONBLOCK.
- Tighten tick to run every 1-2ms instead of 5.
  - This is problematic as the encoder pulses are relatively infrequent, so we'll end up with either 0 or 1 each tick...
  - This may be "okay" if we just make the low-pass filter stronger?

Board improvements:
- Center of mass too far back due to battery, makes it prone to "bucking" under heavy acceleration.
- Nose too big, makes turning towards a wall VERY tight.
- Better connectors for motors and sensor board.
- Velcro'd battery is wobbily standing up on edge.

High-level phases of development:
[x] Learn to operate the hardware.
[x] Learn to drive specific distances / turn specific angles.
[x] Learn not to hit walls.
[ ] Learn to map out a maze.
[ ] Learn to drive the solution to a maze.
